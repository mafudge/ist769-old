# IST769: Advanced Big Data Management

By: Michael Fudge

This course provides a tour of relational, document, key-value, columnar, search, graph and streaming database systems through the lens of scalability. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of several popular database systems in the relational, Hadoop and noSQL spaces. Where possible you will experience these systems first-hand as to gain an understanding of how they can be used to address complex, big data challenges.
